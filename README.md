Computational Practices Homework 1

I have been trying to find a solution on how to add more bubbles for every bubble you click, but it has not been successful. I thought it would be as easy as replacing bubbles.splice into bubbles.push, but it is not that simple. I wish I could have more time to figure this out.

An experience I can think of that correlates to how a CPU runs through instructions linearly performing calculations would ne when I used a calculator to graph an equation. The graph would show where the equation is placed and appears.
